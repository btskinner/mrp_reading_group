Bisbee, J. (2019). "BARP: Improving Mister P Using Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees" _American Political Science Review_ 113:4,
1060â€“1065. [doi:10.1017/S0003055419000480](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/barp-improving-mister-p-using-bayesian-additive-regression-trees/630866EB47F9366EDB3C22CFD951BB6F)

## Data

- From five large surveys (following Buttice & Highton, 2013)
  - Three National Annenberg Election Studies
  - Two Cooperative Congressional Election Studies
- 89 items total
- Sample sizes ranging from 25,000 to more than 60,000 observations
- Treat disaggregated state averages as the "ground truth"
- Use covariate strata proportions to poststratify
- Individual-level covariates:
  - sex
  - race 
  - age 
  - education
- State-level covariates:
  - presidential vote 
  - religious conservatism
- Outcomes:

## Method

- Randomly sample with replacement sample sizes:
	- small (1,500)
	- medium (3,000)
	- large (4,500)
- 200 replications
- To fit models:
  - MRP: [`lme4`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lme4)
  - BARP: custom [BARP](https://github.com/jbisbee1/BARP) package (based on
  [`bartMachine`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bartMachine)
  package)
  - Other (see below): [`SuperLearner`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SuperLearner)
- Other comparison (from Section 7 of [supporting information](https://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:article:S0003055419000480/resource/name/S0003055419000480sup001.pdf)):
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Kernel k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
  - Neural Networks (NNET)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Elastic-net regularization (LASSO)
- Evaluation metrics
  - mean absolute error
  - correlation between predicted state values and "true" values
  - Buttice & Highton (2013) use standardized versions of these
    values; Bisbee shows this version in Figure 1 of supporting
    information --- results are more strongly in favor of BARP over MRP

## Results

- Predictive accuracy (figure 1): 
  - MAE lower with BARP
  - ICC higher with BARP
- Sensitivity to misspecification (figure 2):
  - Drop state-level covariates from model and perform t-test on
    difference
  - BARP appears less sensitive to misspecification
- Sensitivity to within-state sample size (figure 3):
  - BARP less sensitive
- Comparison with other regularization methods (takeaway from supporting
  information, p. 18):
  
  > These comparisons produce three general conclusions.  
  > - First, MRP is competitive with more sophisticated methods in
  >    terms of mean absolute error in larger sample sizes.
  > - Second, BARP is among the best-in-class in terms of mean
  >   absolute error but is more in the middle of the pack in terms of
  >   interstate correlation.
  > - Third, the best methods evaluated in terms of mean absolute
  >   error are not the same as the best methods judged by interstate
  >   correlation. Across both metrics, LASSO regularization is
  >   competitive.

  
  
## Takeaway

- When conditions are good (strong 2nd-level covariates and more
  variation between groups than within), MRP and BARP are about the
  same.
- When less properly specified, BARP may be less sensitive to problems
  than MRP

## An aside to Buttice and Highton (2013)

Poststratification Perform with Conventional National Surveys?

They expect MRP performance (public opinion across states) to be a
function of (p. 453--454):

1. Degree to which individual-level covariates account for opinion
1. Degree to which state-level covariates account for opinion
1. Degree to which true opinion varies across states relative to
   within states

# General Questions

- How much credence should we give to "horse race"-style comparisons
  using real data, particularly when the ground truth is just assumed
  from the data?

- Differences due to use of `lmer()` versus full Bayes via Stan?
