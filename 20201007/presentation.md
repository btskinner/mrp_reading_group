# Motivation

> Prior research on the use of R/E [race/ethnicity] in the social
> sciences has often focused on the actual collection and
> categorization of R/E data (e.g., Denton & Deane, 2010) and how
> participants are categorized into R/E groups, with less attention
> paid to how researchers then use those categorizations in their
> analyses. In this synthesis, we compile the knowledge and insights
> from this literature to further the field’s understanding of how to
> measure R/E in administrative data and then analyze these data to
> understand trends and disparities by R/E. (p. 302)

# Useful background

::: columns

:::: column
## Education as a field
- Low consensus
  - Many are trained in a discipline
  - Others trained in education schools
- Quant/qual divide
- Practitioner/researcher divide
- **Upshot:** researchers using a thousand approaches to analyze data
collected for a thousand reasons under a thousand assumptions

::::

:::: column
## Definitions

- **R/E:** racial and ethnic categories
- **Administrative data:**

> For the purposes of this study, we use the definition of
> administrative data used by Figlio et al. (2017). Administrative
> data sets in education are collected by schools across the K–16
> pipeline (a) that include a census of all students (and possibly
> employees) in that school or institution, (b) that are collected for
> administrative purposes, and (c) with the school, institution, or
> their management organizations "owning" the data (though researchers
> can apply for access). (p. 302)

# Purpose

> The ultimate purpose of this study is to challenge theorists and
> methodologists to develop new frameworks that will be more sensitive
> to complicated R/E identities while also being plausible for those
> using administrative data sets. (p. 302)

# Frameworks: Critical Race Theory

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> Critical race theory in education positions structural inequality,
> racism, and White supremacy as inherent aspects of educational
> system/outcomes, acting as a framework for conceptualizing
> research and interpreting findings on R/E inequality
> (Ladson-Billings, 1998; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995). (p 304)

:::: {.column width=60%}
## Three challenges for quantitative use of R/E

1. Claims of neutrality/objectivity
2. Lack of discussion/recognition of power and structural aspects of
   racism
3. White dominance in the academy

# Frameworks: (Traditional) Quantitative Perspectives

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> ...education researchers have typically utilized R/E with a lack of
> attention or understanding that the categories they utilize are
> superficial and constructed using naive understandings of class and
> race that are then imbued with deficit-oriented markers of
> inferiority and superiority. (p 305)

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}
## Typical statistical concerns

1. Power
2. Precision
3. Parsimony

## Typical outcomes

1. Deficit framing ("achievement gap")
2. Dropping small groups from analysis, or...
3. ...combining into "other" group

::::

# Frameworks: QuantCrit

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> A community of scholars has been purposefully attempting to combine
> critical race theory with quantitative research methods, calling
> this methodology QuantCrit (Sablan, 2019). The goal of these efforts
> is to create a space for quantitative research that engages with
> critical race theory authentically. (p. 305)

:::: {.column width=60%}
## Process that

1. Recognizes flaws in typical quant processes
2. Notes subjective stance of researcher
3. Takes assets-oriented framing

# Methodology

- Systematic review
  - Google Scholar and ProQuest
  - 2001 to 2019
  - Peer reviewed
  - U.S. context
- 55 articles in final analysis set

# Findings: Measuring R/E

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> One clear pattern across the 55 studies included in this research
> synthesis was the heterogeneity in approaches to measuring
> R/E. Between changes over time, differences across populations,
> and methodological choices, measuring R/E was conceptualized in
> dozens of ways across the 55 studies. (p. 308)

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

- Universal Measures 
- U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Agency Guidance
   - Race + ethnicity vs mutually exclusive vs select all
   - Hispanic pan-ethnicity measure is specific challenge
     - inflated "other"
	 - political concerns with granular approaches
- Reliability/Validity
  - R/E identification can change over time...
  - ...and within context

# Findings: Missing R/E data

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> When quantitative education researchers utilize administrative data
> sets, it is a general expectation that R/E data will, at the very
> least, be included as covariates regardless of the analytical
> design. One of the key problems that can arise, however, is missing
> data on R/E. (p. 318)

::::
:::: {.column width=60%}

- Observations often dropped
  - Problem for small groups
- Imputation based on
  - Names
  - Geocoded addresses
  - Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG)

# Findings: Analysis Incorporating Race/Ethnicity

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}

> Several essays and reviews pointed out a common theme in including
> R/E in analysis: doing so without nuance, description, or
> thoughtfulness. While R/E were socially constructed, studies tended
> to include R/E as covariates with the assumptions that these
> variables are independent or causal (N. M. Garcia & Mayorga, 2018;
> James, 2001; Lee, 2009; Ma et al., 2007). (p. 320)

## Suggestions

- Do not (w/o explanation):
  - recode R/E into non-White or "students of color"
  - blame lack of R/E heterogeneity on lack of power
  - explain R/E heterogeneity using biological/genetic arguments (just
    don't ever this one)
- Explain relevance of R/E to study
- Use consistent definitions of R/E

# Possible approaches

## Measurement
- Disaggregate white group
- Decide how race is defined (color? self-identification?)
- Include "most identify/best" follow-up questions
- Add questions about phenotype

## Missing
- BISG

## Analysis
- Incorporate qualitative information
- Fractional R/E assignment for multiracial individuals
- Be explicit about modeling choices

# Questions

- How can we incorporate QuantCrit principals into MRP work?
- Others?
